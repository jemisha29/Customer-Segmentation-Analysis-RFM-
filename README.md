# Customer Segmentation Analysis using RFM Analysis

This project involves creating an interactive Customer Segmentation Dashboard using Power BI based on **RFM (Recency, Frequency, and Monetary)** analysis. 
The dashboard provides valuable insights into customer behavior, segmentation, and revenue contribution. It is designed for business stakeholders to identify key customer groups and prioritize engagement strategies.

### **Features**

- #### **RFM Analysis Metrics:**
  - **Recency (R)**: The time since the last purchase.
  - **Frequency (F)**: The number of transactions made by the customer.
  - **Monetary (M)**: The total revenue generated by the customer.

- #### **Customer Segmentation:**
  - **Champions**: Top customers with high value and frequent purchases.
  - **Loyal Customers**: Regular customers with steady revenue contributions.
  - **Potential Loyalists**: Customers who have made recent purchases and are showing promise.
  - **At Risk**: Customers whose activity is declining.
  - **Lost Customers**: Customers who have not purchased in a long time.

- #### **Key Visuals:**
  - **Overall Summary**:
    - Total Customers
    - Total Quantity Sold
    - Total Revenue
  - **Revenue by Customer Segment**: A bar chart showcasing revenue contributions from different customer groups.
  - **Top 5 Countries by RFM Metrics**: A visual comparison of recency, frequency, and monetary values across the top-performing countries.
  - **Customer RFM Analysis**: A detailed table showing RFM metrics for each segment.
  - **Heatmap**: Displays customers grouped by recency and frequency for quick insights.
  - **Average Customer Revenue**
  - **Customer Segments Distribution**: A donut chart representing customer group percentages.
  - **Geographical Representation**: A map visual highlighting customer distribution across countries.
